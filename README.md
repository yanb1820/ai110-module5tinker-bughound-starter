# 🐶 BugHound

BugHound is a small, agent-style debugging tool. It analyzes a Python code snippet, proposes a fix, and runs basic reliability checks before deciding whether the fix is safe to apply automatically.

## TF Summary

The core concept students needed to understand was that an AI agent is not just a single model call but a pipeline where each step can fail, and the system needs to handle those failures gracefully. Students most often struggled with the gap between what the LLM was asked to return and what it actually returned, because the model would respond in plain English instead of JSON even when the prompt said not to. AI was helpful for suggesting prompt improvements and explaining why a regex pattern would match content inside comments, but it was misleading when it proposed fixes that looked correct at a glance yet silently corrupted docstrings or comment text. To guide a student without giving the answer, ask them to read the agent trace carefully and find the step where the expected behavior and the actual behavior first diverge, then trace that value back to where it was produced in the code.

## What BugHound Does

Given a short Python snippet, BugHound:

1. **Analyzes** the code for potential issues  
   - Uses heuristics in offline mode  
   - Uses Gemini when API access is enabled  

2. **Proposes a fix**  
   - Either heuristic-based or LLM-generated  
   - Attempts minimal, behavior-preserving changes  

3. **Assesses risk**  
   - Scores the fix  
   - Flags high-risk changes  
   - Decides whether the fix should be auto-applied or reviewed by a human  

4. **Shows its work**  
   - Displays detected issues  
   - Shows a diff between original and fixed code  
   - Logs each agent step

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running in Offline (Heuristic) Mode

No API key required.

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Heuristic only (no API)

This mode uses simple pattern-based rules and is useful for testing the workflow without network access.

---

## Running with Gemini

### 1. Set up your API key

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Gemini (requires API key)
* Choose a Gemini model and temperature

BugHound will now use Gemini for analysis and fix generation, while still applying local reliability checks.

## Running Tests

Tests focus on **reliability logic** and **agent behavior**, not the UI.

```bash
pytest
```

You should see tests covering:

* Risk scoring and guardrails
* Heuristic fallbacks when LLM output is invalid
* End-to-end agent workflow shape
